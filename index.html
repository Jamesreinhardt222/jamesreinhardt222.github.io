<h2>My back-story</h2>
<p>Every hero needs an origin story.</p>
<p>I graduated from the university of Victoria with a degree in Biopsychology.  I wanted to go into medical school, so I tried to be really well
    rounded, taking extra courses in philosophy, biochemistry, and genetics.
</p>
<p>After voluneering in a hospital and a psych ward, I decided the medical route wasn't for me.  I wanted something less depressing and more creative.
</p>
<p>I worked in a homeless shelter for a bit, and that was a crazy experience.  I learned a lot about how cruel life can be.</p>
<h2>Blue Coast Research</h2>
<p>My first taste of software engineering was at BlueCoast Research.</p>
